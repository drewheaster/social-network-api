# Social Network API

Welcome to my personal social network! To get started, install your dependencies by running "npm install" in your terminal. Since we don't have any seeds to run, we can simply start up our server once we're ready by typing "npm start".

Once you're in, you can navigate to your insomnia panel and run the queries you wish to complete! Feel free to make a new account, add new friends, and share your thoughts with anyone and everyone!

If you're having trouble relating what you need to do by referencing the code in the repository, please use our [video walkthrough]('https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-W49ICnvUlXr_4vpGcjtzYvkIcctDzd6/view?usp=sharing') as a personal guide to help you through each step of what you need to run to be able to use the application to it's fullest potential!

Thank you for checking out the social network API!

Happy coding!
